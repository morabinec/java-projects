While developing this School Management System, I've gained valuable knowledge and skills including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Creating classes and objects, and applying OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance.
- **Collections Handling**: Managing collections dynamically using ArrayLists and Lists for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Static Methods and Variables**: Utilizing static methods and variables for shared state and cross-instance operations.
- **JavaDoc Documentation**: Writing clear and concise JavaDoc comments to document code functionality.
- **Financial Transactions Management**: Implementing features to handle financial transactions effectively.
