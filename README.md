# Java Projects README

## Overview

This repository contains two Java projects developed in my free time. These projects were created to enhance my understanding of Java programming concepts and to practice software development skills.

### Skills Learned:

- **Basic Java Syntax**: Developed proficiency in Java syntax, including variables, loops, conditional statements, and methods.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implemented OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to design efficient and maintainable code.
- **Input Validation**: Learned techniques for validating user input to enhance application reliability and user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages to users.
- **Application Design**: Gained experience in designing and architecting software applications, including module decomposition and code organization.
